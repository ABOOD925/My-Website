    <!-- Car History Section -->
    <section id="history">
        <h3>Car History</h3>
        <p>The history of cars is rich and fascinating, stretching back over a century of innovation. In 1885, Karl Benz's invention of the first gasoline-powered vehicle revolutionized transportation and changed the world forever. Following this breakthrough, many inventors and companies contributed to the development of automobiles. Henry Ford's introduction of the assembly line in 1913 made mass production of cars possible, drastically reducing prices and making cars affordable for the masses. Over the years, cars have evolved with technological advances, from the first electric cars to modern-day electric vehicles (EVs) that are set to change the future of transportation once again.</p>

    <!-- Car Types Section -->
    <section id="types">
        <h3>Car Types</h3>
        <p>Cars come in a variety of shapes and sizes, each tailored to different needs and preferences. Sedans, for example, are practical vehicles designed for everyday use, providing comfort and fuel efficiency. Sports cars, on the other hand, are built for speed, agility, and performance, often featuring sleek designs and powerful engines. SUVs and crossovers have become increasingly popular due to their spacious interiors and off-road capabilities, making them ideal for families or outdoor enthusiasts. Electric vehicles (EVs) have also emerged as an eco-friendly option, offering zero-emission driving with a focus on sustainability. Whether youâ€™re looking for a family car, a performance vehicle, or an environmentally conscious choice, there's a car type for everyone.</p>

    <!-- Car Parts Section -->
    <section id="parts">
        <h3>Car Parts</h3>
        <p>A car is made up of many complex and interconnected parts, each playing a vital role in its operation. The engine, often referred to as the heart of the vehicle, provides the power needed to move the car. The transmission works alongside the engine to deliver power to the wheels, while the suspension system ensures a smooth ride by absorbing shocks from the road. Other important components include the braking system, which helps stop the car safely, and the electrical system, which powers various features like lights, air conditioning, and entertainment systems. Understanding the function of each part can help you appreciate the technology and engineering behind modern automobiles.</p>

    <!-- Car Safety Section -->
    <section id="safety">
        <h3>Car Safety</h3>
        <p>Car safety is a critical aspect of modern vehicle design. Over the years, the automotive industry has introduced various safety features to protect drivers and passengers. Airbags are one of the most well-known safety innovations, designed to inflate in the event of a collision and cushion the impact. Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) help prevent the wheels from locking up during hard braking, allowing the driver to maintain control. Modern vehicles are also equipped with advanced features such as lane departure warning, automatic emergency braking, and blind-spot detection, all of which help prevent accidents and protect everyone on the road.</p>

    <!-- Fuel & Environment Section -->
    <section id="environment">
        <h3>Fuel & Environment</h3>
        <p>Fuel has been a crucial aspect of the automotive world for over a century, with gasoline and diesel being the traditional sources of power for most cars. However, the environmental impact of fossil fuels, including air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, has prompted a shift towards more sustainable alternatives. Electric vehicles (EVs), powered by batteries instead of internal combustion engines, have emerged as a cleaner option that produces zero emissions. Hybrid vehicles, which combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor, offer a balance of fuel efficiency and reduced environmental impact. The future of automotive fuel is leaning towards clean energy solutions, with ongoing innovations in battery technology and renewable energy sources.</p>
